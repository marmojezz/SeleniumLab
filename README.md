## Introduction
During an interview, 3 exercicies were given to be solved. Basicaly to create automation for do simple things. However, I got extreme dificulty to do that. Firtly, creating an test environment. Second, installing the Selenium for Chrome since I had not the admin permition to install the chromewebdriver. Third, having problems to open a simple URL. I was a disaster.
